    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p> I moved to the United States of America eight years ago from Latvia - a small, but beautiful country located in Northern Europe. I came to the PNW to study and learn amore about the American culure. My original plan was to go back home after I'm done with school; however, life happens. I met my husband here and now I'm planning on staying here in US. Even though all my family is still living in Latvia, I get to visit them every summer and thanks to the technology, I get to speak to them almost every day using Skype or other mobile applications.</p>
    <p>Currently I am a student at Eastern Washington University majoring in Marketing and Visual Communication Design. I am very happy with my chosen field. I highly enjoy the business aspect of marketing and the problem solving, creating aspect of design. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but I'm happy with the knowledge I have gained so far, and I am even more excited about the opportunities the future holds.</p>

    <li>Outdoors</li>
    <p>I love to be outside. During summers my favorite activities are going on a hikes and swimming. I think PNW is the perfect place for everyone who enjoys various kind of outdoor activities. Last summer we hiked the Coulchuk lake trail. I have never seen a more beautiful view. So far I have done only day hikes. I hope that someday soon I'll have a chance to hike overnight, waking up on the top of the mountain with a beautiful view in front of me.</p>
    
    
    <li>Design</li>
    I think the best thing in life is to do what you love and enojy. I am very bless to be able to study design. I hope that one day I'll be able to call myself a professional designer. I also enjoy seeing other people's work and how they solve design problems. I know that I have lot to learn, but I'm excited where I'm headed.
